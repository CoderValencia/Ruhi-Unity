Ruhi: Do things always have to be so repetitive around here?
Awakened: Ruhi…
Ruhi: Huh? I swore I heard something…
Awakened: Don’t be afraid of me.
Ruhi: I DID hear something!
Ruhi: What are you?
Awakened: I am not visible to the human eye. I have no form but I am a piece of you.
Ruhi: Wait, are you the Awakened?
Awakened: Yes.
Ruhi: I’ve heard rumours of you existing but I didn’t think it’d be true!
Ruhi: You supposedly come at a time when someone is in dire hopelessness.
Ruhi: But...why are you here? I’m not hopeless, at least I don’t think I am.
Awakened: I am here to help you find your true self
Ruhi: That’s not possible, I AM already my true self…Aren’t I?
Awakened: The world you’re in is not real. You’re caught in an elaborate illusion
Ruhi:That's not possible.
Awakened: Are you sure?
Awakened: Why do you look so wistfully out of your window wishing to leave sometimes then?
Ruhi: …Well, even if this IS an ‘illusion’, what can I do about it?
Ruhi: I- I can’t leave…I’m needed here…
Awakened: You have the potential and you can do so much.
Awakened: I’m here to help you find yourself, accept and embrace you for who you are.
Ruhi: What’s happening? It feels like I’ve woken up from a bad dream!
Awakened: You have indeed woken up.
Awakened: You are no longer a part of the illusion.
Ruhi: What is happening to me
Awakened: I have bestowed strength and a staff to aid you. Use it to fight for yourself and others.
Awakened: The staff in your hand can be used as a weapon and a shield. As well as a healer, you are now a--
Ruhi: I’m free!! And now I’m so powerful!
Awakened: I wasnt finished--
Ruhi: I can’t stay here! Not when you’ve given me powers to explore!
Awakened: Don’t rush things and let me guide you!
Ruhi: I got this!
