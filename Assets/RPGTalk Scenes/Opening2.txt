Caleb: Oh, Ruhi! Thank goodness you’re in. I was out collecting some food and a Dieran sprang up out of nowhere.
Ruhi: Again? Caleb, please be more careful when you go around.
Caleb: I didn’t hear anything. That beast caught me completely unaware!
Ruhi: That's going to get infected.
Caleb: Not if you heal it.
Ruhi: Rest first, medicine second--
Caleb: --Heal last. I know. I know.
Ruhi: If I healed everyone's cuts and bruises, I'd be the one who needs the healing.
Caleb: I might be the first man to die from cuts and bruises.
Ruhi: Dang it, I'm out of balm. Be right back.
Ruhi: Don't die before I get back, Caleb.
